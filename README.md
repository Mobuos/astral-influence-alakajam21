You can pretend the balls are ores, or maybe people in little pods. They can also be just balls. I didn't have time to think about it, sorry.

Controls:

- Mouse, for dragging planets around

- R, for resetting the level, and unlocking the planets

- Space Bar, for shooting the balls, this locks the planets from being moved!

- Enter, for finishing the current level

There is no music, but you are free to play some spacey music while playing if needed. There are sound effects though.
